 *
 * An implementation of a heap structure that lies somewhere in-between a
 * binary heap and a ternary heap.
 *
 * Any heap structure based on a complete k-ary tree has depth at most O(lg n)
 * when storing n elements, and assuming that k is a constant the insert and
 * delete-min operations will complete in O(lg n) time as well.  However, the
 * constant factors on these operations depend directly on k, so picking a
 * value of k that minimizes the constant factor can help improve performance.
 *
 * To see where the dependence on k comes from, let's think about the worst-
 * case performance of both the insert and delete-min operations.  The insert
 * operation works by inserting the new node as a leaf, then "bubbling up" the
 * node up to the top of the heap.  Assuming that the branching factor of the
 * heap is k, the time required to do this is roughly log_k (n), since each
 * level in the tree contains k^i nodes (for level i).
 *
 * The logic for a delete step is a bit trickier.  To delete the smallest
 * element, we swap the leftmost child node up to the root, then "bubble down"
 * the node until it comes to rest.  In order to do this, we may have to
 * navigate log_k n levels of nodes, at each point swapping the node with the
 * largest of its children.  To find this child takes up to k comparisons,
 * because we have to look at all k children.  This means that the worst-case
 * number of comparisons is roughly k log_k n.  If we want to minimize this
 * function in terms of k, we can treat n as a constant by taking its partial
 * derivative with respect to k and minimizing it.  The math is shown here:
 *
 *     C(k)  = k log_k n
 *
 *                 log n
 *           = k ---------
 *                 log k
 *
 *              k log n
 *           = ---------
 *               log k
 *
 * Now, taking the derivative, we get
 *
 *             log k (log n) - (k log n) / k
 *     C'(k) = -----------------------------
 *                        (log k)^2
 *
 *             log k (log n) - log n
 *           = ---------------------
 *                    (log k)^2
 *
 * Now, we make assume that log k is not zero, because that would imply that 
 * k = 1, in which case our heap is just a linked list and our above math 
 * breaks down.  Then we have that
 *
 *              log n       log n
 *     C'(k) = ------- - -----------
 *              log k     (log k)^2
 *
 * If we set C'(k) to zero and minimize the expression, we get that
 *
 *              log n       log n
 *         0 = ------- - -----------
 *              log k     (log k)^2
 *
 * Multipling both sides by the nonzero quantity (log k)^2, we get
 *
 *         0 = log k log n - log n
 *
 * Dividing through by log n, which we also assume is nonzero (remember, this
 * is an asymptotic analysis)!, we get that
 *
 *         0 = log k - 1
 *
 * So
 *
 *         1 = log k
 *
 * So
 *
 *         e = k
 *
 * So this would imply that the optimal number of children that a k-ary heap
 * should have on each node is Euler's constant!  Of course, this isn't
 * integral, and so, traditionally, heaps are usually chosen to be binary
 * heaps or ternary heaps.
 *
 * The idea behind this particular heap construction is to use a nonuniform
 * branching factor, with the idea being that if we can get the average
 * branching factor to be close to e, then the performance of the heap should
 * be better than would be the case for an integral branching factor like two
 * or three.  In particular,  we choose the branching factors so that three
 * out of every four layers of the heap have branching factor three and the
 * remaining layer has branching factor two.  This gives us the average
 * branching factor of
 *
 *          3 * 3 + 2   11
 *          --------- = --- = 2.75
 *              4        4
 *
 * Which is very, very close to e, 2.71828...
 *
 * As with regular binary or ternary heaps, we store the elements in this
 * structure using a raw array.  In a standard k-ary heap, it's easy math to
 * get from a parent node to its children via multiplication or division, but
 * in this heap structure it's much harder to do so because the branching
 * factor changes on each level.  Consequently, we precompute a lookup table
 * that says, for each row, what the first 0-based index we should expect to
 * find on that row is.  We can then navigate across parents and children
 * using the following trick.  First, we compute the index of the given node
 * in the row that it's currently in (that is, of the nodes in its given
 * layer, which node it is).  Then, to navigate to our parent, we see if the
 * branching factor of the previous row was 3 or 2.  If it was three, then if
 * the current node has zero-based index i into its current row, we want to
 * look at the floor(i/3)th node of the previous layer, and if it was two then
 * we want to look at the floor(i/2)th node of the previous layer.  We can
 * find this value by adding this value to the index of the first node in the
 * previous layer.
 *
 * The indices in this lookup table are given by keeping track of the number
 * of new nodes in the previous layer, then doubling or triping it to see how
 * much to add to the next layer.  The code contained in this file was
 * generated by a separate program assuming the branching factors cycled as
 * 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, etc. and are precomputed up to the largest value
 * that can fit in an unsigned 32-bit integer.
 *
 * To the best of my knowledge this structure has not been previously
 * described anywhere, so this may be a novel invention of mine.  If you know
 * of any work that describes a structure like this, I would greatly
 * appreciate an email to htiek@cs.stanford.edu with a citation.  After all,
 * if I'm duplicating a known result, I'd love to give credit where credit is
 * due.
